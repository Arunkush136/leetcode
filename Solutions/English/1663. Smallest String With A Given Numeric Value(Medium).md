***By Frank Luo***

# Greedy

As we want to minimize the **lexicographical** order of the constructed string, let's start from the **beginning** of the string, select the **smallest** letter that satisfies the requirements each time,  then we get the final answer.

Suppose we are currently constructed to a certain position, as the picture below shows.

![Greedy](https://assets.leetcode.com/users/images/95d7fbe8-01ec-4594-a79a-d773da5b1bcc_1647914018.2457857.png)

Including this position, there are still $n_{rest}$ left to fill in, the remaining sum of these rest positions is $k_{rest}$.
 
If we put a letter $\textit{ch}$, and so the remaining $n_{rest} - 1$ positions with the sum is $k_{rest}$ must satisfy:

$$
1 \times (n_{rest}-1) \leq k_{rest}-ch \leq 26 \times (n_{rest}-1)
$$

can be:

$$
k_{rest}-26 \times (n_{rest}-1 ) \leq ch \leq k_{rest}-1 \times (n_{rest}-1)
$$

So $\textit{ch}$ 

1. $k_{rest} - 26 \times (n_{rest}-1) \leq 0$, we choose the character $a$;
2. $k_{rest} - 26 \times (n_{rest}-1) \gt 0$,  we choose the character corresponding to this value.
 
Let's write the code:
 
```java
    public String getSmallestString_greedy(int n, int k) {
        StringBuilder sb = new StringBuilder(n);
        for (int rest = n; rest >= 1; rest--) {
            int bound = k - 26 * (rest - 1);
            if (bound > 0) {
                char ch = (char) (bound + 'a' - 1);
                sb.append(ch);
                k -= bound;
            } else {
                sb.append('a');
                k--;
            }
        }

        return sb.toString();
    }
```
 
## Analysis

- **Time Complexity**: $O(n)$
- **Space Complexity**: $O(n)$
