# Intuition

We can use [Binary Search](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binary_search_algorithm) method to **exclusive** a half to **reduce** the scale **Each Round**.

```java
public int firstBadVersion(int n) {
        int left = 1;
        int right = n;

        while (left < right) {
            int mid = left + (right - left) / 2;
            if (isBadVersion(mid)) {
                right = mid;
            } else {
                left = mid + 1;
            }
        }

        return left;  
    }
```

## Analysis

- **Time Complexity**: $O(logn)$.
- **Space Complexity**: $O(1)$.
