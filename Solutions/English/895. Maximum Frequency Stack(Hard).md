[Leetcode](https://leetcode.com/)[895. Maximum Frequency Stack](https://leetcode.com/problems/maximum-frequency-stack).

***By Frank Luo***


# Intuition

Let's look at the problem description first.

1. $\texttt{FreqStack()}$ constructs an empty frequency stack.
2. void $\texttt{push(int val)}$ pushes an integer val onto the top of the stack.
3. int $\texttt{pop()}$ removes and returns the most frequent element in the stack.
4. If there is a tie for the most frequent element, the element closest to the stack's top is removed and returned.

The requirements of the problems can be listed in **3** rules:

1. **Pop** the stack by the **max** frequency;
2. Among all the elements  with the same (maximum) frequency, **pop** the element **closest** to the stack's **top**.

To simplify the problem, let's just ignore **rule 2** for now, it looks easier.


# Step 1

We care more about the **frequency** of the elements. We can use $\texttt{HashMap}$ to record the frequency of each element. 

Additionally, we also care about **max Frequency**, the current maximum frequency of any element in the stack. we use the $\textit{maxFreq}$ to store the maximum frequency.

The code is as follows.


```java
    class FreqStack_map {
        Map<Integer, Integer> freqMap;
        int maxFreq = 0;

        public FreqStack_map() {
            freqMap = new HashMap<>();
            maxFreq = 0;
        }

        public void push(int val) {
            int freq = freqMap.getOrDefault(val, 0) + 1;
            freqMap.put(val, freq);
            if (freq > maxFreq) {
                maxFreq = freq;
            }
        }

        public int pop() {
            int ret = freqMap.get(maxFreq);
            freqMap.put(ret, freqMap.get(ret) - 1);
            maxFreq--;
            return ret;
        }
    }
```

This solution has a problem. If the elements with the same frequency, how to judge which element is the newest? 


# Step 2

How to know the order of elements with the same frequency? 

We can use the **stack** to query this information: elements near the top of the stack are always newer.

We consider the elements with the same frequency are **groups**. In a group, elements were stored in the stack. 

Using $\texttt{HashMap}$ combined with LinkedList, the time complexity of inserting and deleting is $O(1)$.

```java
class FreqStack {
    Map<Integer, Integer> freqMap;
    Map<Integer, LinkedList<Integer>> groupFreqMap;
    int maxFreq = 0;

    public FreqStack() {
        freqMap = new HashMap<>();
        groupFreqMap = new HashMap<>();
    }

    public void push(int val) {
        int freq = freqMap.getOrDefault(val, 0) + 1;
        freqMap.put(val, freq);
        if (freq > maxFreq) {
            maxFreq = freq;
        }

        groupFreqMap.putIfAbsent(freq, new LinkedList<>());
        groupFreqMap.get(freq).push(val);
    }

    public int pop() {
        int res = groupFreqMap.get(maxFreq).pop();
        freqMap.put(res, freqMap.get(res) - 1);
        if (groupFreqMap.get(maxFreq).isEmpty()) {
            groupFreqMap.remove(maxFreq);
            maxFreq--;
        }

        return res;
    }
}
```

## Analysis

- **Time Complexity**: $O(1)$.
	- $\texttt{push}$: $O(1)$
	- $\texttt{pop}$: $O(1)$

- **Space Complexity**: $O(N)$.
