[Leetcode](https://leetcode.com/) [50. Pow(x, n)](https://leetcode.com/problems/powx-n/).

***By Frank Luo***

We know how to find $2.0$ raised to the power $10$. The easiest way is to multiply $10$ times $2.0$ by loop, but what if we have to find $2.0$ raised to the power very large number such as $10000$ or more?

We will discuss how to find the solution of such problems by using an fast, efficient algorithm.

# Brute Force

We multiply $a$ to itself $b$ times. That is, $a^b = \underbrace{a \times a \dots \times a}_b$. 

A simple java implementation of that would be:

```java
    public static double myPow(double x, int n) {
        if (n == 0 || x == 1) {
            return 1;
        } else if (x == 0) {
            return 0;
        }

        double ans = x;
        boolean isNegative = false;
        long nLong = n;
        if (nLong < 0) {
            nLong = -nLong;
            isNegative = true;
        }

        for (int i = 1; i < nLong; i++) {
            ans = ans * x;
        }

        if (isNegative) {
            ans = 1 / ans;
        }

        return ans;
    }
```

## Analysis

- **Time Complexity**: $O(n)$
- **Space Complexity**: $O(1)$

# Exponentiation by Squaring

Exponentiation by Squaring can help us in finding the powers of large positive integers. The key is to the **divide the power in half** at each step.

The following recursive approach expresses the same idea:

$$
a^n = \begin{cases} 1 &\text{if } n == 0 \\ \left(a^{\frac{n}{2}}\right)^2 &\text{if } n > 0 \text{ and } n \text{ even} \\
\left(a^{\frac{n - 1}{2}}\right)^2 \cdot a &\text{if } n > 0 \text{ and } n \text{ odd} \\ \end{cases}
$$

Let’s take an example:

$$
3^{10} = 3 \times 3 \times 3 \times 3 \times 3 \times 3 \times 3 \times 3 \times 3 \times 3
$$

Try to divide the power by $2$:

$$
3^{10} = (3 \times 3) \times (3 \times 3) \times (3 \times 3) \times (3 \times 3) \times (3 \times 3)
$$

$$
3^{10} = ((3 \times 3) ^ 5)
$$

$$
3^{10} = 9^5
$$

Effectively, power is divided by $2$ and base is multiplied to itself. So we can write $3^10 = 9^5$.

Now, our problem is to find $9^5$.

$$
9^5 = 9 \times 9 \times 9 \times 9 \times 9
$$

// Try to divide the power by $2$
// Since the power is an odd number here, we cannot do so.
// However there's another way to represent $9^5$

$$
9^5 = (9^4) \times 9
$$

// Now we can find $9^4$ and later multiple the extra $9$ to the result

$$
9^5 = (81^2) \times 9
$$

Effectively, when power is not divisible by $2$, we make power even by taking out the extra $9$. Then we already know the solution when power is divisible by $2$. Divide the power by $2$ and multiply the base to itself.

Now our problem is to find $(81^2) \times 9$

$$
(81^2) \times 9 = (81 \times 81) \times 9
$$

// Try to divide the power by $2$
$$
(81 ^ 2) \times 9 = (6561 ^ 1) \times 9
$$

Finally, we have our solution $3^10 = (6561^1) \times 9 = 6561 \times 9 = 59049$

Let’s use **recusive** in java.

```java
    public static double myPow_quick(double x, int n) {
		long N = n;
		if (n > 0) {
            return quickMul(x, N);
        } else {
            return 1.0 / quickMul(x, -N);
        }
    }

    public static double quickMul(double x, long n) {
        if (n == 0) {
            return 1.0;
        }

        double y = quickMul(x, n / 2);
        if (n % 2 == 0) {
            return y * y;
        } else {
            return y * y * x;
        }
    }
```

## Analysis

- **Time Complexity**: $O(\log n)$
- **Space Complexity**: $O(\log n)$

# Iterative

Although the complexity of both approaches is identical, but if we use **iteration** instead of **recursion** will be faster in practice since we don't have the overhead of the recursive calls and reduce the space.

```java
    public static double myPow_3(double x, int n) {
        long N = n;
        return N >= 0 ? binaryPower(x, N) : 1.0 / binaryPower(x, -N);
    }

    public static double binaryPower(double a, long b) {
		double res = 1.0;
		while (b > 0) {
			if ((b & 1) == 1) {
				res = res * a;
			}
			a = a * a;
			b >>= 1;
		}
		
		return res;
	}
```
