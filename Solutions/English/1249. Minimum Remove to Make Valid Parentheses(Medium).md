# Intuition

First we can use **Brute Force** to into a two-step` algorithm:

1. find all the $($ and $)$ and get their indices;
2. determine the indices that need to be **deleted**;
3. creates a new string from the index of the deleted characters.

We can use a **Stack** to record the indices of all $($ and $)$ s. When scanning to the end of the string, all indices remaining in the Stack are $($ and $)$ s that do not match. 

We also need to use a $\texttt{Set}$ to keep track of unmatched $($ and $)$ s. Then Delete each character that needs to be deleted according to the indices, and return the recreated string.

The code is as follows:


```java
    public String minRemoveToMakeValid(String s) {
        if (s == null || s.length() <= 0) {
            return s;
        }

        int len = s.length();
        StringBuilder sb = new StringBuilder(len);
        Stack<Integer> stack = new Stack<>();
        Set<Integer> idx = new HashSet<>();
        for (int i = 0; i < len; i++) {
            char ch = s.charAt(i);
            if (ch == '(') {
                stack.push(i);
                idx.add(i);
            } else if (ch == ')') {
                if (!stack.empty()) {
                    idx.remove(stack.pop());
                } else {
                    idx.add(i);
                }
            }
        }

        while (!stack.empty()) {
            idx.add(stack.pop());
        }

        for (int i = 0; i < len; i++) {
            if (!idx.contains(i)) {
                sb.append(s.charAt(i));
            }
        }

        return sb.toString();
    }
```
